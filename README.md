### Technical Achievements
**Javascript**: Added a javascript script to the front end in order to control CSS files. I've never had a formal introduction
to pure javascript, and every time I needed something I did it through jQuery. I hope I can have a better understanding of 
base javascript instead of being thrown into helper libraries.

### Design Achievements
**Changing CSS**: I used javascript to change the CSS applied to the page. The page can switch between 2 CSS files: light.css and 
dark.css. There is always a CSS file applied to the page called main.css. I also chose to store the image appearing at the 
bottom of the page inside the CSS files so it can be changed with the CSS files. 

**Resizing Image**: The fixed image on this site resizes with the viewports smallest dimension using vmin. This project allowed
me to learn about the different types of relative length and where they might be applicable. I chose to bound the width and height
of the image using vmin in order to accomodate screens of various sizes. I was particularly thinking of people who were using 
mobile devices or people who have flipped their monitors to be longer vertically in order to see more code on the screen.
I also foun that a lot of sites that do resize images in this way bound it by vh because computer monitors are usually widescreen.
