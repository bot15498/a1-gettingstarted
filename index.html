        <h1>Information about Skyler Kim</h1>
        <p>
          My name is Skyler Kim. <br/>I'm a junior majoring in CS. <br/>I have a little experience with ASP .NET, but I would like to learn more. 
          <br/>I look forward to working with all of you this term.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my free time, I like to play Pokemon VGC. <a href="https://pokemonshowdown.com/users/bettyflores">Here is my showdown account.</a>
          <br/> The new format just got released, so I'm not as high on ladder as I would like to be.
          <br/> My favorite pokemon is Mimikyu because of how versatile it can be.
